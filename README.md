# gDel3D Python Bindings - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION ✅

**Status: ✅ FULLY WORKING - Real gDel3D algorithm integrated successfully!**

This project provides Python bindings for the gDel3D library, enabling fast GPU-accelerated 3D Delaunay triangulation from Python. The implementation uses the real gDel3D CUDA algorithm to compute optimal 3D triangulations.

## 🎯 What This Does

Given a set of 3D points, this library computes the 3D Delaunay triangulation and returns a list of tetrahedra, where each tetrahedron is defined by the indices of the input points.

**Input**: Array of 3D points `[[x1,y1,z1], [x2,y2,z2], ...]`  
**Output**: List of tetrahedra `[[i,j,k,l], ...]` where each represents indices into the input points

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
import numpy as np
import gdel3d

# Define your 3D points
points = np.array([
    [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
    [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], 
    [0.5, 1.0, 0.0],
    [0.5, 0.5, 1.0]
])

# Compute 3D Delaunay triangulation
tetrahedra = gdel3d.compute_delaunay(points)
print(f"Generated {len(tetrahedra)} tetrahedra")
```

## 📦 Installation & Build

### Prerequisites
- CUDA Toolkit (tested with CUDA 12.9)
- Python 3.x with numpy
- pybind11
- CMake 3.18+
- GPU with compute capability 8.6+ (RTX 30/40 series)

### Building
```bash
# Install pybind11
pip install pybind11[global]

# Build the real implementation
mkdir build_single && cd build_single
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j$(nproc)

# Copy module to project directory  
cp gdel3d.cpython-*-linux-gnu.so ..
```

## 🔧 Technical Solution

### Breakthrough: Single Compilation Unit Approach
The key breakthrough was resolving Thrust template symbol mismatches by using a single CUDA compilation unit approach:

**Problem**: When compiling gDel3D sources separately, Thrust templates were instantiated with different architecture symbols, causing linking failures:
```
undefined symbol: _ZN6thrust...THRUST_200802_SM_860_...
```

**Solution**: Compile all CUDA sources together in a single compilation unit, ensuring consistent Thrust template instantiation across all object files.

### Build Configuration
The working CMake configuration (`CMakeLists.txt`) uses:
- Single target with all CUDA sources included
- `CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION OFF`
- Single architecture: `CUDA_ARCHITECTURES "86"`
- Main binding file as `.cu` (CUDA) rather than `.cpp`

## 🧪 Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python test_real_gdel3d.py
```

Run the demonstration:
```bash
python demo_real_gdel3d.py
```

## 📚 API Reference

### `compute_delaunay(points)`
Compute 3D Delaunay triangulation from numpy array.

**Parameters:**
- `points`: numpy array of shape (N, 3) containing 3D coordinates

**Returns:**
- List of tetrahedra, each as `[i, j, k, l]` indices into input points

**Example:**
```python
points = np.random.rand(100, 3) * 10  # 100 random points
tetrahedra = gdel3d.compute_delaunay(points)
```

### `compute_delaunay_from_list(points)`
Compute 3D Delaunay triangulation from list of tuples.

**Parameters:**  
- `points`: List of (x, y, z) tuples

**Returns:**
- List of tetrahedra, each as `[i, j, k, l]` indices into input points

**Example:**
```python
points = [(0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0.5,1,0), (0.5,0.5,1)]
tetrahedra = gdel3d.compute_delaunay_from_list(points)
```

## Original gDel3D Information

This is based on the refactored gDel3D repository that works with recent CUDA architectures.
Original repo: https://github.com/ashwin/gDel3D

This program constructs the Delaunay Triangulation of a set of points in 3D using the GPU. The algorithm used is a combination of incremental insertion, flipping and star splaying.
